# GTA:V Top Categorizer

What I've come to realize about how Rockstar organizes clothing for GTA:V is that it doesn't make any sense.

This is a set of tools that lets you organize images of tops, torsos, and undershirts to put them into different categories.

## Tops

Tops (11) are classified in 1 of 6 categories.

- empty
  - This means no clothes are worn
- monster
  - This is anything that has to do with costumes
- none
  - This top requires no undershirt
- open
  - This top requires a full undershirt from neck to waist
- partial
  - This top requires an undershirt from neck to chest
- vest
  - This top requires sleeves, or nothing

## Torsos

Torsos are categorized based on the first `15` torsos available for GTA:V.

All torsos can effectively be categorized into `1 of the 16 categories` of torsos. This includes gloves.

However, an additional category `16` is used for the `monster` category.

## Undershirts

Undershirts are categorized just like tops are categorized.

- empty
  - This means no clothes are worn
- monster
  - This is anything that has to do with costumes
- none
  - vests, police batons, etc. pretty much fits on any perfectly fit clothing
- open
  - neck to waist undershirt
- partial
  - neck to chest undershirt
- vest
  - sleeves, and vest fitting
